A series of business case studies related to the financial industry, solved by myself in Python leveraging machine learning techniques at PoliMi. Notably: 
-clustering the customers of a bank to give them personalized financial advices. The final solution uses Principal Component Analysis to extract relevant features from the dataset followed by the K-Medoids algorithm with Gower's distance to cluster.
-detecting anomalies in the markets and identifying risk-on and risk-off weeks through copulas.
-nudging customers of a bank towards investing with online learning. The framework is the one of the Bandit algorithms where two approach are proposed, namely Thomson sampling and UCB1.
